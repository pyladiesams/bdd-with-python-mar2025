# BDD with Python 
### Presentation: [Introduction to BDD in Python](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t8gkZ9HH19cT_fM4AAfu3gPutuJZXZ2U1twyL3JOwhc)

## Workshop description
This workshop introduces Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) in Python using behave and pytest-bdd. BDD helps teams write tests that are easy to understand and closely aligned with business requirements by using Given-When-Then scenarios in plain language.

BDD bridges the gap between developers, testers, and stakeholders by encouraging collaboration, promoting clean, well-tested code, and making test cases more meaningful and maintainable.
